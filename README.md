# StrappyTemplate
put on your straps for the bootstrap template. This template is a part of my web development course at Coursera.

# what's in there for you?
<li>carousals</li>
<li>media objects</li>
<li>tootltips</li>
<li>breadcrumbs</li>
<li>modals</li>
<li>forms</li>
and lots more which i leave for you to discover.

# what all is needed?
1. clone the project
2. run `npm install` to add node modules
3. and then you are all set to run with `npm run start`
4. in case you change scss files i have a ready made script for you to compile it into css. All you need to do is `npm run sass`.
